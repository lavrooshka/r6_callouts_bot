# r6_callouts_bot_tg

This is a small bot to practise your callouts Rainbow Six Siege maps.
I understand that many sites have different names that might even contradict each other, however I tried to stick to the most popular and widely accepted callouts.
As far as I know, KiXSTAr is working on the universal callout guide so when it's released, I'm planning on refreshing schematics and quizzes.
Some parts of the bot are still work in progress, so you could encounter placeholders.
